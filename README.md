This folder contains the main scripts used to generate the main tables (supplementary table S1-S5) in the article 'A trans locus causes a ribosomopathy in hypertrophic hearts that affects mRNA translation in a protein length-dependent fashion' by Franziska Witte, Jorge Ruiz-Orera et al., currently published in Genome Biology (2021). These scripts can be used to predict QTLs and translated ORFs, the main output that was used to build the images and explain the results. For the rest of methods, the published used software and the employed parameters are described in each section of the publication.
