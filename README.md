This folder contains the main scripts used to generate the main output tables used in the article 'A trans locus causes a ribosomopathy in hypertrophic hearts that affects mRNA translation in a protein length-dependent fashion' by Franziska Witte, Jorge Ruiz-Orera et al., currently published in Genome Biology (2021). These scripts can be used to predict QTLs, translated ORFs and estimate heritability. These are the main output that was used to build the Figures and explain the Results. For the rest of methods, the published used software and the employed parameters are described in each section of the publication.
