# witte_et_al_2021
This folder contains the main scripts used to generate the main output tables in the article 'A trans locus causes a ribosomopathy in hypertrophic hearts that affects mRNA translation in a protein length-dependent fashion' by Franziska Witte, Jorge Ruiz-Orera et al., currently accepted for publication in Genome Biology (2021). These scripts can be used to map RNA-seq and Ribo-seq datasets, and use these mapped files to predict QTLs and estimate heritability, as well as translated ORFs. This is the main output that was used to build the Figures and Results. For the rest of methods, the used public software and the chosen parameters are described in each Methods section of the publication.
